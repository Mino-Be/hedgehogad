In the pipeline, a real-time aero-dynamic model which handles omni-directional airflow has alsobeen introduced. However, their framework requires a capturedmotion, which implies that their model is not suitable for designinga customized motion. In this paper, we present a method to adduser-controllability to the aerodynamic model in OmniAD by al-lowing the user to directly interact with the aerodynamics model.The system first visualizes the force and torque coefficients, whichrepresent(ùë•,ùë¶,ùëß)components of aerodynamic force (i.e., drag andlift force) and torque, as a set of arrows on a sphere. The user thenmodifies the arrows on the screen as desired. The system updatesthe internal representation (parameters for spherical harmonics)and shows resulting animation. We run a user study and the partic-ipants successfully designed physically plausible falling motionsusing the proposed method.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Abstract\n","import React from 'react';\n\nimport Header from './scripts/header';\nimport Abstract from './scripts/abstract';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Header />\n      <body>\n        <h2>Abstract</h2> <Abstract />\n      </body>\n      <footer>\n      </footer>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
